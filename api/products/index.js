This mode exists problems as follow:<br \/><br \/>1. Great investment in pipeline, 80-90% of total investment.<br \/><br \/>2. Serious leakage of pipeline. Due to the construction quality and uneven settlement, leakage in pipelines is unavoidable and causes large area cross-contamination of sewage and groundwater.<br \/><br \/>3. The sludge is difficult to dispose of and the treated water is difficult to reuse. Sludge disposal usually adopts methods as landfill and incineration, which require the large area of land and fuel as well as generated secondary pollution. At the meantime, the treated water is far away from the downtown for reusing.<\/p>",

The use of concrete and steel, however have their own particular disadvantages. Steel, for example, corrodes very easily - particularly in coastal environments and therefore the tanks must be repainted periodically. Concrete tanks have a tendency to crack. Small cracks can lead to seepage and the possible tainting of the water. In severe cases fracture may occur which could cause the possible loss of use of the tank. These problems can be avoided by using HOT PRESSED GRP PANEL which provide very uniform, strong and stable construction.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Rubik's Cube is not just a forgotten toy from the 80's.

		"excerpt": "<p><strong>FlowGuard&reg;<\/strong> pipe &amp; fittings are made from a specialty plastic known chemically as chlorinated polyvinylchloride (CPVC), which offers increased product toughness year round and simplified installation using readily available, inexpensive tools.<\/p>",
		"content": "<p><strong>Why Installing CPVC Plumbing Systems Saves Time And Money Over PPR<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, commonly known as CPVC is a safe, durable, chlorine resistant, antimicrobial and recyclable material. CPVC pipe and fittings are used in hot and cold water plumbing systems and satisfy international potable water piping standards for today&rsquo;s residential homes, apartments, hotels and commercial buildings.<br \/><br \/>However, some wonder about the merits of polypropylene (PPR) as compared to CPVC. PPR is a newer material used in residential plumbing systems. But before choosing PPR over CPVC, consider one important facet of the materials: installation.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>CPVC PPR Installation Comparison<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Tools<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>CPVC can be installed with simple, inexpensive, non-electric hand tools. These tools are easy to obtain and typically don&rsquo;t require a great deal of space on a job site, nor special permits to use.<br \/><br \/>In contrast, PPR requires specialty tools that only operate with an electrical source. Each worker needs access to an expensive welding machine, which heats up to 250&deg;C and could cause burns. For joints larger than 32 mm, an even more labor-intensive process and additional tools are required.<br \/><br \/><strong>Labor Costs<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Because CPVC is simple to install. Usually, a plumber or installer with minimum instruction can handle a CPVC installation by himself, keeping costs down.<br \/><br \/>PPR, on the other hand, uses heat welding which is more time consuming than solvent welding CPVC. This is especially true in elevated or tight spaces. And, with hundreds of joints in a project, solvent welding CPVC will lead to overall savings in labor costs, up to 50% in some cases.<br \/><br \/><strong>Installation Workspaces<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Thanks to CPVCs&rsquo; lightweight and the simple tools required to install it, no complicated, cluttered or large workspace is needed. Additionally, because it doesn&rsquo;t need to be prefabricated before installation, all installation can be done directly at the install site. All in all, CPVC installation is time-effective because workspaces can be flexible.<br \/><br \/>PPR installation doesn&rsquo;t have the same luxuries. In fact, much of a PPR plumbing system requires prefabrication, which means a separate workspace is needed outside of the installation area. And, if unforeseen installation obstacles arise, more time is required to prefabricate new or additional pieces of pipe. Furthermore, the specialty tools require more space than those needed for CPVC, which can be challenging in a cramped job site.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rubiks-cu.be\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rubiks-Cu.be<\/a> is a website dedicated to cube puzzle.
